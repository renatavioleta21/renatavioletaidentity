Development of this new Identity for the next years 

I'm writiing in english I thinj I need to, maybe in a few years I'm going to review this ans in the same way I whatch my kindergarden book with 9 year old and I painted all over again inside the line and with better colouring, in some years if I keep moving forward with my english writting and can correct all over and over again.

I'm doing this excersice this time because Im already did it in spanish, the development of a digital identity and how is this necessary but also a strategy to keep yoursel your deeply self away from social media pressure, remember you all the time that you are already someone, that you dont need the aproval of anyone, and that you can get off of everything if one day you decide that and be easy whit this. Because the important can't be the unportant, and the unportant can be the important. I know that is complicated but we are all just trying to find a way and be okey with this and have some meaning, also happinest, roots and connections.

I really like where this is taking me I dont know where are going to arrived but I'm already enjoing the path and the travel, just siiting here in my chair in front of my computer keyboard.

The first one is that I need to mapping all the tools taht I'm testing

The most dificult part is to have the focus and mental straight be a community manager of yourself, you have to remember that freedom come with big responsabilities and at the end you can't depends of nothing there is something call interdependency, I realiced that because my dream of bean completly free witout any atach is not happening, you always going to be atach to something or someone, because you can't live by your own, you need the space, the air, the food, the shelter, and the interdependency always going to existe if you have a work 8 to 5 okey, if you have a husband that gives to you money, okey, if you are "free" and you are seeling your sould for some tips, or something to get pay at the end, and make a living. 

Freedom is in your mind,in your sould and that is really dificult to achieve, so this it's not an attemp to be free or something this is an attemp to understand what it takes to do things in a diffent way at least a try and create documentation about it so, someone else can do something with this after, maybe in a few year with AI or something.
